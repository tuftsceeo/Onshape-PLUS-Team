## Direct Connection
This code allows the user the update a color sensor assembly by calling the OnshapeAPI directly from the EV3.

## Labview Connection
This **Labview** code was the initial connection technique. I utilized **Systemlink Cloud** in order to communicate from the EV3 to my laptop running a Labview program, updating a FeatureScript.
